Currently it supports working with Genbank, Uniprot and generic fasta sequences. Basic functionality includes:\r\n\r\n- Parses and accessors for Genbank and Uniprot XML and fasta format.\r\n- A wrapper for BLAST.\r\n- A wrapper for signalP.\r\n- A very simple persistence mechanism.\r\n- Mechanisms for lazy processing of sequences from very large sequence files.\r\n- Interfaces for search and retrieval of sequences from online databases.\r\n- Translation functions for DNA and RNA sequences.\r\n- ID mapping functionality using the Uniprot's ID mapping tool.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
