# `clj-biosequence`

`clj-biosequence` is a library designed to make working with
biological sequence data easier. Basic functions include:

- Parses and accessors for Genbank, Uniprot XML, fasta and fastq formats.
- A wrapper for BLAST.
- A wrapper for signalP.
- A wrapper for TMHMM.
- Indexing of files for random access.
- A simple MongoDB interface.
- Mechanisms for lazy processing of sequences from very large files.
- Interfaces for search and retrieval of sequences from online databases.
- Translation functions for DNA and RNA sequences.
- ID mapping functionality using the Uniprot's ID mapping tool.

## Installation

Available from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/clj-biosequence). For the
current version add the following to your project.clj file:

```clojure
[clj-biosequence "0.1.4-SNAPSHOT"]
```

To use in your namespace:

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [clj-biosequence.core :as cbs] ;; for base functionality and fasta
  	        [clj-biosequence.uniprot :as up] ;; for Uniprot functionality
	        [clj-biosequence.genbank :as gb] ;; for Genbank functionality
	        [clj-biosequence.blast :as bl] ;; for BLAST functionality
            [clj-biosequence.fastq :as fq] ;; for fastq functionality
            [clj-biosequence.index :as ind] ;; for indexing functionality
            [clj-biosequence.interproscan :as ips] ;; for interproscan functionality
	        [clj-biosequence.signalp :as sp] ;; for a wrapper for signalp
            [clj-biosequence.store :as st] ;; for a mongoDB interface
            [clj-biosequence.tmhmm :as tm] ;; for a wrapper for TMHMM))
```

## Basic usage

`clj-biosequence` provides a reader and sequence mechanism for the
lazy access of biosequences in a variety of formats. For example, if
working with fasta sequences a typical session in the REPL could go
something like:

```clojure

;; import core and fasta functions

user> (use 'clj-biosequence.core)

;; to use test files included in library use clojure.java.io.
;; Otherwise string or java file object can be used.
;; For fasta an alphabet is also required to initialise a file.

user> (def fa-file (init-fasta-file (resource "test-files/nuc-sequence.fasta") :iupacNucleicAcids))
#'user/fa-file
user> 
```
