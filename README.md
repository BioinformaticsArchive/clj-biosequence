# `clj-biosequence`

clj-biosequence is a library designed to make working with biological sequence data easier. Currently it supports working with Genbank, Uniprot and generic fasta sequences. Basic functionality includes:
1. Parses for Genbank and Uniprot XML and fasta format.
2. A wrapper for BLAST.
3. A wrapper for signalP.
4. A very simple persistence mechanism.
5. Mechanisms for lazy processing of sequences from very large sequence files.
6. Interfaces for search and retrieval of sequences from online databases.

Written by biologists and not computer scientists so improvements and
suggestions welcome.
