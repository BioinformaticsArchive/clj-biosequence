# `clj-biosequence`

clj-biosequence is a library designed to make working with biological sequence data easier. Currently it supports working with Genbank, Uniprot and generic fasta sequences. Basic functionality includes:

- Parses for Genbank and Uniprot XML and fasta format.
- A wrapper for BLAST.
- A wrapper for signalP.
- A very simple persistence mechanism.
- Mechanisms for lazy processing of sequences from very large sequence files.
- Interfaces for search and retrieval of sequences from online databases.

Written by biologists and not computer scientists so improvements and
suggestions welcome.
